   <p align="right"> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard

     It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 
     It was popularised in the 1960s with the release ofLetraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop

     when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of 
     letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing 
     packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover

      (injected humour and the like).
